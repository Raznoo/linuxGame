You tread onwards, deeper into the dungeon's expanse. You pass dozens of similar rooms and passages, some look awfully familiar, others stranger everything else. You eventually make it to what is likely the final room. A wide granite door blocks your path. Intricate carvings are all over it, somehow untouched by time and the elements. You step closer to inspect it and.. wait.. you think you can hear a whisper coming from behind the door.
